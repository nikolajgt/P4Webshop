The flow of the program:

	1. When úser use an endpoint, the http request will first hit our CustomerAuthenticationHandler (Middleware)
		There it will depending on the token either get succed and sets HttpContext.User and allow the request to the controller
		or returns ResponseErrorCode

	2. After that the request hits the controller and it checks for role authorize attributes and then we can get the user claims (ID, username etc..)

	3. And now its normal flow through out the program, just with a tad more switch cases and generic repos


	There is documentaion on JWT Classes, Test controller, User controller, base user model, IGenericUserRepository and GenericUserRepository


	What technology are used for now:
		- JWT ---> with roles, custom middleware, Custom attributes.
		- Identity core for taking care of all user funcitons fx log in, create user and so on.
		- Generic repository for creating crud for all user types
		- A bit of model polymorphism with user as base model
		- AutoMapper
		- Health check
		- Background workers ---> Cancelletion tokens

	// Delivery/order service
		
		Customer:
			- Customer should be able to track orderd package(s) and sort them
			- Customer should be able to reject package, and package returns to shop (Money back except delivery cost)
			- Customer CAN regret purchase in for 3 days (Maybe a way to send package back)
			- Customer gets notified when package arrived.
		
		Admin: 
			- Admin can see all ordred package with name from buyer and package ID
			- Admin can reject order/create order for user


		Backend: 
			- Every orderd package gets a unique id to track it (Just use Pk?).
			- If item is not in warehouse, set delivery longer.
			- When package returns, add it to warehouse.


		Extra toughts on backend:
			- Would it be a good idea to implement google user service to our program. This way we can send notifications to user without it be only on website and its good REAL WOLRD training
